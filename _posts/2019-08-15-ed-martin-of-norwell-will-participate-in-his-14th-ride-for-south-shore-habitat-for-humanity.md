NORWELL, MA, ISSUED JULY 25, 2019…Ed Martin of Norwell started it all when he created the Ride for Habitat 13 years ago. His support for South Shore Habitat for Humanity began when he helped build a home in Hingham many years ago then he realized he could turn his hobby into a fundraiser to build more homes.

“I enjoy cycling and thought other cyclists would want to join in,” said Martin, a business owner of Fifield e-bikes. “And for non-cyclists, they can support the organization through the cyclists’ fundraising.”

Raising money through the Ride is vital for South Shore Habitat to continue building affordable housing.

“Past Rides have raised a significant amount to help fund home builds,” Martin continued. “My goal is to raise enough funds in one ride to build an entire home. We haven’t hit this milestone yet, but maybe this year will be the year!”

On Ride day each year, Ed arrives early to prepare the course. “The community and local business are very supportive. They know we’re coming every year and they’re ready for us.

“My family and friends ride - and enjoy the beautiful scenic loop - while I bring up the rear to help ensure everyone completes their ride safely. And then it’s barbeque time. Almost the best part!”

Ed Martin is also a long-time, active volunteer and has helped build many SSHH homes. His support helps build safe and healthy homes for families in need of affordable housing.

Everyone is invited to join in the Ride for Habitat, September 14 in Hingham and you too can help change lives with
